A simple disaster management website 
has no backend or database
User inputs a disaster with the level of priority, and it automatically assigns  requirements like food, water, etc., based on priority

It also assigns zones, such as Red zones for higher priority disaster and allocates disastermanagement teams
It uses simple sorting algorithms from DSA to sort the zones based on given proirity
